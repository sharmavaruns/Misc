In case Jupyter Notebook isn't rendering try going to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org and then pasting in the URL (https://github.com/sharmavaruns/Misc/blob/master/Relay_Tx_stuff/metrics_evaluation_checkpoints_model.ipynb) to the notebook to render it.
For some reason I've had issues with my Jupyter Notebooks correctly rendering on Github.
