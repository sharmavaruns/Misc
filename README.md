# Misc
Various code snippets or jupyter notebooks I've put together for fun.

Most likely this is code that isn't super clean and perhaps not directly clonable and runnable, especially with respect to dependencies. When I've got some time to circle back I'll try and give explicit directions on any dependency issues.
TLDR: Check this code at your own risk ;).

## projects uploaded here:
- coding_interview: Was a coding interview that I had for a Machine Learning internship position in the drug discovery space.
  - 'coding_interview_completed.ipynb' has my implementation and 'coding_interview_original.ipynb' has the original questions
  - Highlights include:
    - Problem 1: simple Palindrome algorithm question
    - Problem 2: parsing in files
    - Part 2: multi-class classification machine learning problem on pokemon data set.
